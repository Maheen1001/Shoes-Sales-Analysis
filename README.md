# Shoes-Sales-Analysis
### *Overview*
An assumed Shoes Brand, which is an SME based in Morpeth, Northumberland, is an e-commerce firm specializing in domestic and international branded shoes. The company aims to compete with high-street shoe retailers but lacks internal expertise in data analytics. To address this, we analyzed their sales data to uncover trends, profitability insights, and shipping efficiency.
The analysis was conducted using Python for data processing and Tableau for creating visualizations. The dataset included sales transactions, shipping details, returns, and sales representatives, all provided in Excel sheets.

### *Objective*
The primary goal was to create an interactive dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of Shoes Ltd.'s performance. Key areas of focus included:
  Sales and profit trends across different periods.
  Regional sales performance and potential areas for growth.
  Shipping efficiency, including on-time delivery rates.
  Customer segmentation to identify high-value customers.
  Product performance to identify top-selling items.

### *Key Insights*
*Sales and Profit:* The company achieved Â£493,416 in sales with a 21.5% profit-to-sales ratio. There is room for growth by expanding the customer base and increasing sales volume.
*Regional Performance:* England dominates sales, but regions like Scotland and Wales show potential for expansion through targeted marketing.
*Shipping:* Late deliveries were most frequent in the Midlands and East regions, suggesting a need for logistics optimization.
*Customer Segmentation:* Important Value Users, making up 37.13% of the customer base, are crucial for profitability, indicating a focus on retention and personalized marketing could be beneficial.
*Product Analysis:* Certain products, like "Novo Smart, Full Size," were top sellers, highlighting the need to optimize the product portfolio by focusing on high-demand items.

### *Outcome*
The analysis provided with actionable insights to improve their business strategy, focusing on enhancing profitability, optimizing shipping processes, and expanding their market presence.
